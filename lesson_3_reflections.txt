When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    和別人共同合作的時候就會需要用到 remote repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    手動的 pull change 讓自己更能控管程式當下的狀態, 總是和遠端保持相同狀態
    會使在本地端開發中的檔案後到更動, 甚至產生衝突。

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork 是把別人Github的儲存庫, Clone 一份到自己的 Github 上
    Clone 是複製別人的儲存庫, 從網路或是本機的其他位置
    branch 則是分支, 跟複製無關, 就是區別出該分支版本含其他分支版本有差異, 
    之後可以再合併...etc
